# Lacking Game Engine

![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mokiat/lacking-rs/master/logo.png)

This project is a port of my WIP hobby game engine/framework [lacking](https://github.com/mokiat/lacking) originally written in Go into another language that shall not be named. Until the `you-know-which` language has cleared up its trademark policy, this port is mostly frozen.

Currently, this project has a two-fold goal:
* It is a learning experience for me to try out the language that shall not be named and make comparisons with Go.
* If it manages to meet my expectations and overcomes some shortcomings of Go (mostly in WebAssembly aspect), it might become the official library.

This project is a WIP port. Even the original project is WIP. So **avoid using this for now**, since the API is guaranteed to change in backward incompatible ways.
