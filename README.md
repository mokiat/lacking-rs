# Lacking Game Engine

![logo](logo.png)

Lacking is a Rust port of my WIP hobby game engine/framework [lacking](https://github.com/mokiat/lacking) originally written in Go.

Currently, this project has a two-fold goal:
* It is a learning experience for me to try out Rust and make comparisons with Go.
* If Rust manages to meet my expectations and overcomes some shortcomings of Go (mostly in WebAssembly aspect), it might become the official library.

As such, **avoid using this for now**, since this is a heavy WIP and the API is guaranteed to change in backward incompatible ways.
